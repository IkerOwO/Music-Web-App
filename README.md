# Music web app created on Blazor

There aren't any songs included (I didn't want any problems with the authors)

3. Open the :5001 direction on a browser
4. Go to "Songs" and hit the Scan button
5. When you open the app again you need to hit the "Open from Json" button

 # The app only works while you have the terminal open
